The Enigma Machine was used by the Germans during world war II to encipher/decipher secret messages.

The cipher worked in multiple stages. When a key would be pressed an electrical signal is sent down a wire corresponding
to that letter. The wire first goes through the steckerboard (plugboard) where 10 pairs of letters (i.e. the wires
corresponding to those letters) are swapped. The wires then go into the 1st rotor where it is scrambles with all the
other wires in a prespecified way which is unique to this specific rotor. It then goes through two more rotors, each
with their own unique scramble. The signal then enters the reflectors where the 26 wires are grouped in to 13 pairs.
Each wire is connected to its pair. The signal then travel on the other wire in the reverse direction, from the
reflector, through 3 rotors and through the steckerboard where it powers a bulb corresponding to the enciphered letter.

Each time a key is pressed, the first rotor is also rotated by 1 place. For every full rotation of a rotor (26
keystrokes), the subsequent rotor is rotated once (or twice for some rotors) sometime during the rotation. Thus with
each letter of the message there is a different cipher.

Each day there are a different set of 3 (out of 5 or 8) rotors, with different places in the rotation which knock (cause
to rotate) the next rotor, and a different set of 10 pairs of letters for the steckerboard. Additionally, for each
message a different starting position for the rotors are selected.
